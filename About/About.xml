    <description>Snowy Trees mod v0.20.0 - Makes plants snowy when they are covered by snow.
Changelog:
v20- b19 support, swap definitions are now XML based.
v19.2- Fixed bug that caused plants in the leafless state but have no leafless sprite to not swap the regular sprite when snowed on.

v19.1- Fixed bug that caused errors when plants added by other mods got snowed on.

v19- Refactored the tree swap code, not that it was an issue, but by making fewer string comparisons it runs faster now. Added snow graphics for the leafless versions of: Birch, Cypress, Maple, Oak, Poplar, and Willow Trees. Added snow graphics for Agave and Willow Tree.

v0.18.0t- Removed HugsLib dependence.
