Open the zip file
Go to your RimWorld install folder (by windows default its C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld) and open the "Mods" folder.

## Changes
v0.19
Refactored the tree swap code, not that it was an issue, but by making fewer string comparisons it runs faster now.
Added snow graphics for the leafless versions of: Birch, Cypress, Maple, Oak, Poplar, and Willow Trees.
Added snow graphics for Agave and Willow Tree.

0.18.0t
Removed HugsLib dependence.

## Licensing
Unsure of licensing info, as Nandonalt didn't originally publish anything in that respect. All credit goes to Tejko for updating to a17/Harmony, all I did was delete a line or two and recompile to achieve b18 compatibility.
